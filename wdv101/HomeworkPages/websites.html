        <section>
            <p> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/"> YouTube</a></p>
            <p> I like youtube for its simple and intuitive design, it also looks good while being simple.
            I think youtube has one of the better dark mode designs as well, it works well and doesnt just make everything black</p>
            <p> <a href="www.netflix.com">Netflix</a></p>
            <p> I like Netflix because it does exactly what you want it to do without adding a bunch of extra unessary things, it is very easy to use as well</p>
            <p> <a href="www.reddit.com">Reddit</a></p>
            <p> I like reddit, again because the design is simple and easy to use. I like this one more than the others
            because you can choose if you want an old UI or the new one, they dont force you to switch if you didnt want to</p>
