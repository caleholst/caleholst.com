<hr />
<p>1. Define a variable call schoolName. Display the variable in the console. *Review the value of a variable that has been defined but has not been assigned a value.</p>
<p>2. Assign &quot;DMACC&quot; to schoolName. Display the variable in the console.  *The quotes make this a String data type.</p>
<p>3. Assignment 42 to schoolName. Display the variable in the console. *This changes the datatype of the variable from a String to a number. Notice that a JavaScript variable changes datatype based upon it contents.</p>
<p>4. Define a variable called courseName and assign it a value of WDV221 Intro Javascript. Use document.write() to display the value of the variable within the following paragraph instead of courseName shown below.</p>
	<p>Hello! Welcome to <script>document.write(courseName);</script></p>
<p>5. Define a variable called testScore and assign it a value of 100.00. Use console.log() to display the value of the variable. *Notice how JavaScript treats the .00.</p>
<p>6. Define a variable called courseGrade. Assign it a value of 88.65. Use console.log( ) to display the value of the variable. *Notice how JavaScript treats this number.</p>
<p>7. Define a variable called courseCompleted. Give it a value of false. Use console.log( ) to display the value of the variable. *Notice this is NOT a String datatype. true and false are reserved word within Javascript.</p>
<p>8. Assign a value of &quot;false&quot; to courseCompleted. Make sure and use the &quot;&quot; to make this a String datatype. Use console.log( ) to display the value of the variable. *Notice the difference between 7 and 8.</p>
<p>9. Create a variable called stringType. Assign it a value that makes the variable String data type. Use console.log( ) to display the variable stringType</p>
<p>10. Create a variable called numberType. Assign it a value that makes the variable a number data type. Use console.log( ) to display the variable numberType.</p>
